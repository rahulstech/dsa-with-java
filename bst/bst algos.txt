1. how morris inorder traversal works

inorder: left -> mid -> right

steps:

loop until cur is non null
  if has no left
   print current
   current = current.right
  if has left
   - goto the right most node of the left subtree of current i.e. the predecessor node
     - if right of predecessor is current, break the link and current = current.right
     - otherwise link it to the current current = current.left
     

2. least common ancestor (LCA) of p and q:

NOTE: it is confirmed that both p and q exist in the tree

if current is null or current is same as p or q
  return current
 
left = LCA in left subtree of current
right = LCA in right subtree of current
if both left and right exist
  return current as LCA

return the non-null of left or right as LCA

understand with example
p = 10 q = 7
	  1
        /    \
       5      7
      / \    / \
      6  3  4   9
          \
          10

 
when cur = 1 the 
left recursion return 10
right recursion returns 9
why? because when the recursion reach the subtree with root 10 then the first if condition meets i.e. cur == p or q. same reason for subtree with root 9. 
since 10 and 9 are found in two different branch therefore 1 is lca

p = 5 and q = 7
then, left subtree with root 5 (left tree) returns lca = 5
right subtree with root 7 (right tree) returns null because it does not contain 5 or 3. 
now since it is ensured that p and q definitely exists but neither or p or q exists in right tree. so p and q both exists in left tree.
now for left tree cur = p i.e. cur = 5 matches therfore it is the lca.
